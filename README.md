# ubuntuVM
Example of an ARM script to configure and deploy an Ubuntu VM on Azure from a local machine.


### Technicalities

The ARM template requires a URI for the config file to be run on the VM, which should be provided by this repo.  This can be done using a permanent link to the file in github.  This is created in github by browsing to the file, displaying the raw version, then pressing "y" as a shortcut to convert the link shown in the browser to a `permalink.`  _I bet you din't know that._
